## Migrations

Some of the changes require a migration. Depending on how you run BETY you can use one of the following options. No matter what, make sure you have a backup of your database before you do the migration, just in case.

### Native Install

You will need to install the latest version of BETY (or the version you want to migrate to), and run `rake db:migrate SKIP_SCHEMASPY=YES`.

### Docker (with docker compose)

In this case you can simply pull down the version you want, and run `docker-compose bety migrate`.
