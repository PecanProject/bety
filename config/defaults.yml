    The emerging biofuel industry may aid in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
    decreasing dependence on foreign oil importation.

  marked_up_block_text:

    How to develop and implement biofuel crops in an ecologically and economically
    sustainable way requires evaluating the growth and functionality of biofuel
    crops from the local scale to the regional scale. <strong
    class="green">BETYdb</strong> has been developed to support research,
    agriculture, and policy by synthesizing available information on potential
    biofuel crops.
