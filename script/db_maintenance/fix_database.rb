DESCRIPTION

This script generates a file of SQL statements to fix the sequence objects and
table ids in the public schema of the specified BETYdb database.  It assumes id
numbers were mis-allocated in the 99 billion range and that rows having ids in
that range should be reassigned id numbers in the range appropriate to the
machine specified by the user (see \"correct_machine_id\" below).

Database connection information may either be specified in a YAML file
\"connection_information.yml\" (see \"connection_information.yml-sample\" for an
example) or prompted for interactively.  The user should also specify the number
of the target machine and the name of the file to write the SQL statements to.

HOW TO USE

Steps for using the script are as follows:

1. Take BETYdb instance that uses the target database off line.

2. (Optional) Write a YAML file called connection_information.yml in the same
   directory where this script resides that contains database connection
   information, the id number of the machine using the database, and the name of
   a file to write SQL statements to.  See the CONNECTION SPECIFICATION and
   OTHER SCRIPT PARAMETERS sections below.  You may use
   connection_information.yml-sample as a model.

3. Run the script.

4. Check that there are appropriate foreign-key constraints on all tables that
   refer to any table mentioned in any of the generated UPDATE statements.
   These foreign-key constraints should use the \"ON UPDATE CASCADE\" clause.
   You may use the \"find_missing_constraints.rb\" script to check what
   foreign-key constraints may be missing.

5. If the necessary constraints are present, run the SQL statements in the
   generated file.

6. Restore the BETYdb instance that was taken off line in step 1.


CONNECTION SPECIFICATION

The user should specify connection parameters for the database to be used.
Specifically, the following must be specified:

    host:     The host machine of the database (usually \"localhost\")
    user:     The role name to use to connect to the database
    password: The password for the specified user
    dbname:   The name of the database being connected to
    port:     The port number used for the connection

These may be specified in a YAML file named \"connection_specification.yml\"
having top-level key \"connection_info\" and the above 5 items as sub-keys.  Any
item not specified in the file will be prompted for.  (If the file doesn't
exist, all items will be prompted for.)

OTHER SCRIPT PARAMETERS

In addition to database connection parameters, the user must provide:

    correct_machine_id: The machine id for the machine using the specified
                        database

    output_file:        The name of the file to which SQL statements should be
                        written

These may be specified as top-level keys in the YAML file.  Otherwise, they are
prompted for.
