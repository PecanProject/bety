DESCRIPTION

This script attempts to find missing foreign-key constraints by finding column
names of the form "xxx_id" and checking to see if there is an existing
corresponding foreign-key constraint.  Certain columns with names of the form
"xxx_id" that are known not to be foreign keys are filtered out.  A list of
missing foreign-key constraints is printed to standard output.

HOW TO USE

Steps for using the script are as follows:

1. (Optional) Write a YAML file called connection_information.yml in the same
   directory where this script resides that contains database connection
   information, the id number of the machine using the database, and the name of
   a file to write SQL statements to.  See the CONNECTION SPECIFICATION and
   OTHER SCRIPT PARAMETERS sections below.  You may use
   connection_information.yml-sample as a model.  (The correct_machine_id and
   output_file keys are not relevant to this script and will be ignored if
   provided.)

2. Run the script.  A list of missing foreign-key constraints will be printed to
   standard output.

CONNECTION SPECIFICATION

The user should specify connection parameters for the database to be used.
Specifically, the following must be specified:

    host:     The host machine of the database (usually \"localhost\")
    user:     The role name to use to connect to the database
    password: The password for the specified user
    dbname:   The name of the database being connected to
    port:     The port number used for the connection

These may be specified in a YAML file named \"connection_specification.yml\"
having top-level key \"connection_info\" and the above 5 items as sub-keys.  Any
item not specified in the file will be prompted for.  (If the file doesn't
exist, all items will be prompted for.)
