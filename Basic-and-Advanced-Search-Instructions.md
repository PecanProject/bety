Basic search:

1.	Got to the home page. (This will be either: http://pecandev.igb.illinois.edu/bety, https://ebi-forecast.igb.illinois.edu/beta, or https://www.betydb.org.)
2.	Enter one or more terms in the search box.  Each term must match one of (1) the scientific name of a species; (2) the common name of a species; (3) the name of a treatment.  Thus, the more terms entered, the more restrictive the search.  In addition to normal search terms, the keywords “trait” or “yield” may be entered to restrict the type of data returned.
3.	Click the search icon next to the search box (or press the ENTER key).  This will take one to the search results/advanced search page and show the result of the search.

Advanced search:

1.	From the home page, you can get to the advanced search page simply by doing a basic search.  (Or just click the search icon without entering any terms.  Or enter the URL for the advanced search page directly by appending “/searches” to the URL given in step one of the Basic search instructions.)
2.	By default, the search will return results for both traits and yields.  Use the radio buttons to restrict results to one or the other.
3.	Enter one or more terms in the main search box.  As with basic searches, each term must match one of (1) the scientific name of a species; (2) the common name of a species; (3) the name of a treatment.  (Unlike basic searches, the “trait” and “yield” keywords are not recognized.  Using them here will most likely eliminate all search results since they don’t match the name of a species or treatment.  Use the radio buttons instead in order to restrict the search type.)
4.	Press the Submit button to obtain search results.
5.	Narrowing Search Results: Once you have obtained a search result, you may refine the result by applying further restrictions using the “Narrow your search” panel on the right side of the page.  Enter terms in one or more of the three search boxes there to limit results by Site, by Species, or by Trait.  Then either click one of the “Apply Limit” links or click the Submit button again.

Notes:
1.	Search terms or case-insensitive and a search term will match a species name, treatment name, site name or trait name if it matches any part of the name.  Thus, simply typing “misc” will match against “Miscanthus”, “Miscanthus sacchariflorus”, “Miscanthus sinensis”, or “Miscanthus X giganteus”.
2.	The “species” search box in the “Narrow your search” panel only matches against scientific names.  To match against common names, put the term in the main search box.
3.	For sites having no formal site name, the city name is shown instead.  Note however that when narrowing your search by site, the term entered will only be matched against site names.
4.	The layout of the advanced search page looks best when your browser window is as wide as possible.
