  description: Rd; leaf dark respiration
  units: umol CO2 m-2 s-1
  notes: Not really "dark respiration" Often this is respiration that occurs in the
    light. Date and time fields "should" identify pre-dawn (nightime/dark)  leaf resp
    vs the Rd that comes from a A-Ci or A-PPFD curve

  notes: ! "Asat is saturated by light, with ambient CO2; see Amax for light + CO2
    saturated photosynthesis (https://www.betydb.org/variables/158/).  \r\n\r\nThere
    isn't a clear convention on this: Asat and Amax definitions are sometimes reversed
    in the literature. But Asat and Amax are very different. "
