module SimpleSearch

  # simple_search turns a search string into an object usable as an
  # argument for an ActiveRecord '.where()' clause in one of the
  # following ways:
  #
  # * If the argument +search+ contains at least one <tt>=</tt> sign,
  #   the search string is assumed to be a comma-separated sequence of
  #   column-value specifications of the form <tt>column_name =
  #   value</tt>.  Each such specification in which the column is a
  #   column in <tt>self.column_names</tt> (or in which the column is
  #   one of the columns specified in the +SEARCH_FIELDS+ array, in
  #   the case where +self.column_names+ is +nil+, as might happen if
  #   this module is used in a class other than a model) is added as a
  #   key-value pair to the +conditions+ hash returned by this method.
  #
  # * Otherwise, if the +search+ does not contain a <tt>=</tt>
  #   character, a search-string template is created containing a
  #   clause of the form <tt>columnName like :wildcard_search</tt> for
  #   each column in <tt>self::SEARCH_FIELDS</tt> (or in
  #   +self.column_names+ if +SEARCH_FIELDS+ is nil) that is not of
  #   type _boolean_, _datetime_, or _integer_.  If the entire search
  #   string is a single character representing a boolean value--that
  #   is, either '1', '0', 't', 'T', 'f', or 'F', then a clause of the
  #   form <tt>columnName = :search</tt> is added for each column of
  #   type _boolean_.  If the entire search string consists of digits,
  #   then a clause of the form <tt>columnName = :search</tt> is added
  #   for each column of type _integer_.  Finally, if a date can be
  #   parsed out of the search string, a clause of the form
  #   <tt>(columnName > :date_start_search and columnName <
  #   :date_end_search)</tt> is added for each column of type
  #   _datetime_.  Finally, all these clauses are joined by " or ".
  #   The Hash object corresponding to the template has keys :search,
  #   :wildcard_search, :date_start_search, and :date_end_search whose
  #   corresponding values are the entire search string, the search
  #   string surrounded by '%' characters, a date one day before the
  #   date parsed out of the search string (or nil if none was found),
  #   and a date one day after the date parsed out of the search
  #   string (or nil), respectively.
